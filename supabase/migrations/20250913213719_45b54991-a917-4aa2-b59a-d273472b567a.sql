-- The broker_profiles table already has all necessary columns including profile_image_url and passport_document_url
-- This is just to ensure the table is properly set up with all fields from the broker setup form
-- No changes needed as the table already contains all required fields:
-- profile_image_url, passport_document_url, and all other broker setup data fields

-- Let's just verify the table structure is correct
SELECT 'broker_profiles table already has all required fields' as status;
